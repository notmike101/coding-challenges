Q1. OOP general programming

In the real world, a man has a mouth. His mouth can do operations like open/close at the man's will.

* He can open and close his mouth as he wishes.
* Nobody can force a man to open/close his mouth.
* A doctor can ask a man to open/close his mouth and a man will do so.
* He refuses anyone else who asks him to open/close his mouth other than doctors

Use OOP Designs to make needed classes with methods to meet those requirements. You can use any language or pseudo-code to write down your results.
